# Blackjack Project

# Description:
This was a fun project! We were to create a simulated Blackjack game. To start, the player is welcomed to the table, the dealer has a new deck of cards, the dealer shuffles the deck, and begins dealing. Once the player has been dealt their cards, the value of their hand is printed. At this point they are given the option to hit or stay. If they hit, a card will be removed from the deck, added to their hand, and their updated hand value will be printed to the screen. If the player hits Blackjack on the first cards they are dealt they will be crowned winner and will be given the option to quit or play again. When a player decides to stay, the dealers hand will be printed to the screen and compared to determine the winner. As the player can decide to stay at any point, if the dealers hand value is less than 17, they must continue to hit. If the player and dealer end up having hands with equal values, there will be no winner and a new game will start.

# Lessons Learned:

This project was challenging and honestly, crucial to my learning and my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, writing and using methods, creating a plan and following a UML diagram, and keeping organized in my code. Specifically, I felt that I developed a much better understanding of inheritance and abstraction. The "where, how and why?" clicked during this project. Although, one lesson that I certainly learned this weekend was to use my time as efficiently as possible. I felt somewhat uncertain on a few things and went into a review rabbit hole. I'd say there are less productive things to spend your time on but this took valuable time away from me to create the best possible project I could. I was left scrambling Sunday night trying to debug my program. My final product could be less dry and maybe more efficient. As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, I will come back to these types of projects and probably laugh but most importantly, I will revise the work I've done so my Github repository is full of project that I am proud of. In total, I feel that I took a lot away from this weekends project and that is all that I could ask for.
